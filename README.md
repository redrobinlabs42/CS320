## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is functional and secure I needed to test for every possible use case. When doing this I had to make sure the requirements are addressed and make sure my tests are not bias in many factors. As the developer we want our code to pass our tests and this could lead to non-extensive tests. The consequences of this are that we miss certain use cases and scenarios that could potentially break the code. This can also lead to memory leaks amongst other security issue.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To incorpoorate user needs into the program we ensure that requirements gathering has been thourough. Throughout my development and tests I would reference user needs and requirements along with the documentation. Having the requirements of a project well laid out before hand is crucial to being able to ensure I am not missing any of my users' needs. It also helps out with the process of making sure that all tests are tested and passed as a result of checking the functional requirements. As this project is well laid out ahead of time it was much easier, but in other projects I must remain agile and be able to adjust to changes and additional requirements. This means taking all of the time upfront to ensure that the requirements are laid out in an orderly manner.

## How do I approach designing software?

My approach to software design is simplicity and functionality. It is easy to make simple mistakes in software when your designs become overly complex. This is especially true in large enterprise systems. It is important that my software functions properly and meets all requirements, but I will also need to make revisions if the code is overly complicated or contains ambiguous parts. The biggest thing is making sure that there is some kind of SLA that is kept for the software.
