## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is functional and secure I needed to test for possible use cases. When doing this I had to make sure the requirements are addressed and make sure my tests are not bias. As the developer we want our code to pass our tests and this could lead to non-extensive tests and may miss certain use cases and scenarios that could potentially break the code.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To incorpoorate user needs into the program is by ensuring my requirements gathering is thorough. Throughout my development and tests I would reference user needs and requirements. Having the requirements of a project well laid out before hand is crucial to being able to ensure I am not missing any of my users' needs. As this project is well laid out ahead of time it was much easier, but in other projects I must remain agile and be able to adjust to changes and additional requirements.

## How do I approach designing software?

My approach to software design is simplicity and functionality. It is easy to make simple mistakes in software when your designs become overly complex. It is important that my software functions properly and meets all requirements, but I will also need to make revisions if the code is overly complicated or contains ambiguous parts.
